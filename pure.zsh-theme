# Pure - A minimal and beautiful theme for oh-my-zsh
#
# Based on the custom Zsh-prompt of the same name by Sindre Sorhus. A huge
# thanks goes out to him for designing the fantastic Pure prompt in the first
# place! I'd also like to thank Julien Nicoulaud for his "nicoulaj" theme from
# which I've borrowed both some ideas and some actual code. You can find out
# more about both of these fantastic two people here:
